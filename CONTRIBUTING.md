# How to contribute

Thanks for considering to contribute to JsonLines! Just follow these single guidelines:
- You must follow the PSR-2 coding standard. More info [here](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). With these tweaks:
    - Always use spaces!
    - Ensure the coding standard compliance before committing or opening pull requests by running `php-cs-fixer fix .` or `composer cs-fix` in the root directory of this repository.
    - Please follow the used commit message format, which is `<commit-message>.( Fixes | Closes #<issue-number>.)`.

- All features or bugfixes must have an associated issue for discussion. If you want to work on a issue that is already created, please leave a comment on it indicating that you are working on it.

- You must use [feature / topic branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows) to ease the merge of contributions.
